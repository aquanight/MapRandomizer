          <p>If enabled, the player may transfer regular energy into reserve tanks. After setting the reserve tank mode to MANUAL, press D-Pad Left to move the cursor to the large arrow. Press the A button and the arrow will switch directions.</p>
          <p>The arrow indicates which way energy will transfer when the "RESERVE TANK" item is activated: normally it points from the reserve tank up to regular energy, and it will always return to this state when leaving the equipment menu (to view the map or to unpause). When toggled, it will instead point down, from regular energy, into the reserve tank. Thus, energy will be transferred from regular energy tanks to reserve tanks.</p>
          
          <p>When using this feature, if reserve energy is overfilled, then regular energy instantly depletes to 1, similar to the vanilla behavior which instantly depletes reserve energy to 0 when regular energy is overfilled.</p>
